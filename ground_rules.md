h1. Ground Rules

Suggestions for how a team could get the most out of a hackday

* We are not playing to win, we are playing to play. (Also, simple maths dictates we`re likely to win anyway)
* Do what you do best, do what you enjoy.
* Share ideas freely.
* Collaborate where possible, nothing is too simple to explain (if required). 
* If someone from another team asks for help you can give, help them.
* Relax, if things get stressful, take a break.
* There is room for team building/'creativity exercies'/silly games.
