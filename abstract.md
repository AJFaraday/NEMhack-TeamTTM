To build on the test-to-music algorithm (http://www.github.com/ajfaraday/text-to-music) in order to explore ways of expanding this algorithmic method of making music.

Areas to explore include: 
* sympathetic visual representations of text
* interactions with the sound synthesis
* audience interactivity using game controllers (game pad, kinekt etc.)
* sentiment analysis affecting resulting art

---------------------

There are two likely outcomes to this project:

An audio/visual installation, anchored in a location and/or event where it`s situated. Where people can experience the 'buzz' around that event and/or location being created online via the text-to-music sound and a visual representation of this same buzz. There may also be scope for viewer participation within this space.

A collaborative browser-based app where users contribute to the twitter search term(s) in play, the server of this site would be running the text to music script and delivering this back to users via an audio stream, along with the resulting tweets themselves. The focus here would be on adapting text-to-music to work within a web framework and finding ways to allow users to socially interact with the resulting sound.

------------------------

One or both of the above outcomes could fit these challenges` criteria:

* 3. Open City Database Challenge - The OCD API could be used as a text source. Rich cultural information about could be fed to users via a musical or audio-visual experience. Using the Open City database as the basis for an informative, locally relevant installation work.
* 6. Wiki-Art - By developing an ingtermediary web-app users could interact with a running text-to-music algorithm in a number of ways, by providing text directly, or search terms for it to find and work with. There could also be interactions with the synthesis process. We could apply rules to whether or not a user`s interaction is made a part of the result, perhaps a twitter search term could be voted up or down and the top term at any moment in time is used, or a change to the sound production would have to be confirmed by another user to take action, but could be rejected by another user once active.
* 8. NEMart challenge - the text-to-music algorithm gives a basic template for both artists and programmers to spread their creative wings. With a system in place to take text from any source, and use it to produce a steady stream of instructions which could be used for any real-time application. Users can concentrate on either side of this equation without having to worry about the other part. Likely outcomes include art.
